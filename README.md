# prismformat
This bit of code can be used to convert long format monthly climate data from PRISM to 12-column format. It is funky but functional. To use, you need to start with monthly climate data downloaded from https://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/. If you enter your latitude and longitude, you can extract and download data for a single monthly variable. The data comes in a long format with a combined year-mo column. Adjust my code to fit your needs. I've included an example dataset from PRISM.
